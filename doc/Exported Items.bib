	abstract = {Pauses can be used to facilitate certain operations involved in the production and in the perception of speech. In the case of speech perception, pauses have been found to improve the accuracy of detection and the recall of lists of digits and letters. The aim of the present experiments was to examine the effects of pause time on the perception of sentences. In experiment I, a semantic categorization task was used and in experiment {II} a sentence recall task. The results indicated that in sentences containing pauses between clauses, words were categorized more rapidly (experiment I) and propositions were recalled more accurately (experiment {II)} than in sentences containing pauses, within the clause. The results are interpreted in the context of existing models of speech processing, and the significane of pause time for cognitive activity is discussed.},

@misc{bikel_randomized_2004,
	title = {Randomized Parsing Evaluation Comparator},
	url = {http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~dbikel/software.html#comparator},
	abstract = {A persistent problem with parsing—particularly with English—is that of repeatedly evaluating on the same test set, noting increases in evaluation metrics like labeled bracket recall and precision, but not knowing if those differences are statistically significant (there is another, perhaps more serious problem with repeatedly evaluating on the same test set, but don’t get me started on that here). To address this issue, I have written a short Perl script that reads that output of evalb on two different parsing runs and outputs p-values for whether observed differences in recall and/or precision are statistically significant.

    The test employed is a type of “stratified shuffling” (which in turn is a type of “compute-intensive randomized test”). In this testing method, the null hypothesis is that the two models that produced the observed results are the same, such that for each test instance (sentence that was parsed), the two observed scores are equally likely. This null hypothesis is tested by randomly shuffling individual sentences’ scores between the two models and then re-computing the evaluation metrics (precision and recall, in this case). If the difference in a particular metric after a shuffling is equal to or greater than the original observed difference in that metric, then a counter for that metric is incremented. Ideally, one would perform all 2n shuffles, where n is the number of test cases (sentences), but given that this is often prohibitively expensive, the default number of iterations is 10,000. After all iterations, the likelihood of incorrectly rejecting the null is simply (nc + 1)/(nt + 1), where nc is the number of random differences greater than the original observed difference, and nt is the total number of iterations.

    Caveat: This type of testing method assumes independence between test instances (sentences). This is not a bad assumption for parsing results, but is not correct, either.

    Warning: the script is provided as is; use at your own risk (although it can’t really harm anything to try it out).},

As a previous work necessary to develop it, some automatic and semiautomatic processes have been carried out: automatic morphological analysis and disambiguation; manual validation of the tagging process, which guarantees the quality of the data; and, finally, automatic shallow parsing. The syntactic annotation consists of the labelling of constituents, including some elliptical elements, and syntactic functions. In this paper we focus on the second phase, presenting the basic guidelines for syntactic annotation and the boundaries of the work being done.},

	doi = {{10.1162/coli.07-056-R1-07-027}},
	abstract = {Parsing algorithms that process the input from left to right and construct a single derivation have often been considered inadequate for natural language parsing because of the massive ambiguity typically found in natural language grammars. Nevertheless, it has been shown that such algorithms, combined with treebank-induced classifiers, can be used to build highly accurate disambiguating parsers, in particular for dependency-based syntactic representations. In this article, we first present a general framework for describing and analyzing algorithms for deterministic incremental dependency parsing, formalized as transition systems. We then describe and analyze two families of such algorithms: stack-based and list-based algorithms. In the former family, which is restricted to projective dependency structures, we describe an arc-eager and an arc-standard variant; in the latter family, we present a projective and a non-projective variant. For each of the four algorithms, we give proofs of correctness and complexity. In addition, we perform an experimental evaluation of all algorithms in combination with {SVM} classifiers for predicting the next parsing action, using data from thirteen languages. We show that all four algorithms give competitive accuracy, although the non-projective list-based algorithm generally outperforms the projective algorithms for languages with a non-negligible proportion of non-projective constructions. However, the projective algorithms often produce comparable results when combined with the technique known as pseudo-projective parsing. The linear time complexity of the stack-based algorithms gives them an advantage with respect to efficiency both in learning and in parsing, but the projective list-based algorithm turns out to be equally efficient in practice. Moreover, when the projective algorithms are used to implement pseudo-projective parsing, they sometimes become less efficient in parsing (but not in learning) than the non-projective list-based algorithm. Although most of the algorithms have been partially described in the literature before, this is the first comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the algorithms within a unified framework.},
