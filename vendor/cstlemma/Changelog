Version 3.0 (10 December 2008)
------------------------------
Added UTF-8 capability, but only for the new type of flexrules.
(Affix rules). A new option has been added, -eU (or -eu), telling that the
input is in UTF-8 encoding.
No case conversion is attempted when making an internal dictionary if -eU is
specified, so it is important that the word list that is used for making the
dictionary has the desired case for all words and lemmas. When a word is looked
up in the internal dictionary, the word is first looked up "as is". If it isn't
found, the word is converted to all lower case and a new look up is attempted.

For the UNICODE case folding use has been made of CaseFolding-3.2.0.txt
(http://unicode.org/Public/3.2-Update/CaseFolding-3.2.0.txt)

Cstlemma can now effectively handle alphabetized input. Previously, words were
stored in a binary tree as they were read, resulting in an enormously
unbalanced data structure if the words came in alphabetical order, which again
resulted in either stack overflow or long running times. From version 3.0 the
words are stored in a hash.

The tree - and now the hash - is used to build a list of types. Words (tokens)
that occur more than once in the input are still only lemmatised once.
------------------------------
Version 2.13 (16 April 2008)
------------------------------
Added new command line option -en, n indicating ISO8859 encoding.
n=1: Western European
n=2: Central European
n=7: Greek
n=9: Turkish

Also added support for new type of flexrules that allow wildcards anywhere in
the pattern. These rules are stored in a binary file. The implementation of
the algorithm that creates these rules is not part of CSTlemma (yet). No new
command line option is added for the support of these new rules.

------------------------------
Version 2.12 (23 February 2007)
------------------------------
Added support for Turkish (ISO8859_9).

------------------------------
Version 2.11 (14 November 2005)
------------------------------
Change in basefrm::addFullForms that solves a problem with multiply listed full
forms.
Made a correction to Lemma::addFreq that makes the binary dictionary slightly
smaller, but does not seem to have influence on the output.

------------------------------
Version 2.10 (9 December 2005)
------------------------------
Sorted output and tagged input didn't work well: the program went down.
Added sorting routine for tagged words.
Also added check in translate function in tags.cpp.

------------------------------
Version 2.9 (6 October 2005)
------------------------------
Addition of R and C flags. With the C flag you can discard the least well-
supported rules after the generation of a set of flexrules. This decreases
the size of the set and can solve problems with overfitting. The R flag adds
each rule's support to the flex rule file, so that you can see how many words
from the training set are lemmatised by a given rule.

Changed the format of the flex rule file. Before, the base form ending was put
between [ and ], which lead to problems if the base form contained these
characters (as in CO[2]). The new format uses tab-characters to separate base
form ending from full form endings. If you still want the old format, set
TABASSEP = 0 in flex.cpp.

Added code to explicitly delete some objects just before ending the program.

------------------------------
Version 2.8 (26 August 2005)
------------------------------
Solved error with lemma-based disambiguation.
Updated version number and date.

------------------------------
Version 2.7 (23 August 2005)
------------------------------
New sorting option -q# which sorts output by frequency.
Solved an error with reading text into lines. If there were trailing blanks
at the end of a line, the first word of the next line was erroneously moved
to the end of the current line.

------------------------------
Version 2.6 (03 August 2005)
------------------------------
Added support for ISO8859-7 (Greek)and for Unicode UTF-8 (not tested fully yet).
Edit caseconv.h to select the encoding.

------------------------------
Version 2.5 (29 July 2005)
------------------------------
Solved two errors in flex rule generation. The most severe one caused half 
of the lines in the input to be ignored if the input only had two columns
(full form and base form). As a result of the fix, patterns must contain 
one character (F, B or ?) per column and not, as before, have a ? for a
non-existing column (because this caused every second line to be ignored).

------------------------------
Version 2.4 (3 March 2005)
------------------------------
Removed (undocumented) requirement that word classes must be capitalised.

------------------------------
Version 2.3 (24 February 2005)
------------------------------
Problem solved with -I option. (input format) 

------------------------------
Version 2.2 (23 February 2005)
------------------------------
Problems with generation of flex rules and dictionary solved.
Addition of $s field (word separator that expands to blank or new line) in -c
format.

------------------------------
Version 2.1 (27 January 2004)
------------------------------
General beautification of code.
Introduction of C++ streams instead of file pointers (optional).
Lemmata can contain uppercase characters.

----------------------------
Version 2.0 (5 January 2004)
----------------------------
Initial version under GPL

-------------------------
Version 1.0 (Autumn 2002)
-------------------------
Initial non-GPL version.
